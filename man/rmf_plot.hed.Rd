\description{
Plot a MODFLOW head file object
}
\details{
There are three ways to specify which time step to plot.
The \code{l} argument can be specified which represents the dimension index. This can be smaller than the total number of time steps since output may not be written for all steps.
The second option is to specify \code{nstp} which is the total time step number. Since output at every time step is not always written, a specified nstp value might not be available in the array.
The third option is to specify both \code{kper} & \code{kstp} which specify the stress-period and corresponding time step in that stress-period.
A negative \code{kstp} will plot the final time step of the stress-period.

If \code{saturated} is TRUE, the saturated grid is plotted as given by \code{\link{rmf_convert_dis_to_saturated_dis}}, which might be useful
for cross-sections to show the true saturated surface.

If no output is written for the specified time step, as controlled by the Output Control file in MODFLOW, an error is thrown.
