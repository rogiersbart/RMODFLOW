\description{
Add rmf list class to data.frame and check if k, i and j columns are present
}
\details{
\preformatted{ rmf_lists represent List Data input (and output) as used by MODFLOW. rmf_lists are used to define stress period input for boundary condition packages; 
 to define parameters and to read certain types of output in the the cell-by-cell budget file. A MODFLOW List Data can be viewed as discrete spatial features in contrast to the MODFLOW array data type which represents continuous data.
 
 A rmf_list is a dataframe with at least 3 integer columns k, i and j, that may contain repeated values.
